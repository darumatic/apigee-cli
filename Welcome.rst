Please note that this CLI is still highly experimental and may change significantly
based on client needs.

--------------------
Why does this exist?
--------------------

It is intended for general administrative use from your shell, as a package for developers,
and to support automation for common development tasks, such as test automation
or Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When to use this over the official tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Apigee Corporation maintains their own fully-featured CLI for the Apigee Management API`_
that can be used as an SDK to orchestrate tasks and may be more than suitable for your needs.

Our Apigee CLI provides a simpler command-line experience with CI/CD and SSO features in mind.

We built and use the Apigee CLI to implement and distribute features that allow our clients
to manage CI/CD, perform self-service operations and promote our DevOps workflows
which are difficult to perform using official tools.
