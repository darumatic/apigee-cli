Installation
============

The easiest way to install apigee-cli is to use `pip`_ in a ``virtualenv``::

    $ pip install apigeecli

or, if you are not installing in a ``virtualenv``, to install globally::

    $ sudo pip install apigeecli

or for your user::

    $ pip install --user apigeecli

If you have the apigee-cli installed and want to upgrade to the latest version
you can run::

    $ pip install --upgrade apigeecli
