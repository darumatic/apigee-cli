Please note that this CLI is still highly experimental and may change significantly
based on client needs.

------------
Installation
------------

The easiest way to install apigee-cli is to use `pip`_ in a ``virtualenv``::

    $ pip install apigeecli

or, if you are not installing in a ``virtualenv``, to install globally::

    $ sudo pip install apigeecli

or for your user::

    $ pip install --user apigeecli

If you have the apigee-cli installed and want to upgrade to the latest version
you can run::

    $ pip install --upgrade apigeecli

--------------------
Why does this exist?
--------------------

Apigee CLI is a user-friendly command-line interface to the Apigee Edge Management API providing
automation capabilities with multi-factor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on (SSO)/SAML support.
It is intended for general administrative use from your shell, as a package for developers,
and to support automation for common development tasks, such as test automation
or Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
How we and our clients use it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We built and use the Apigee CLI to implement and distribute features that allow our clients
to manage CI/CD, perform self-service operations and promote our DevOps workflows
in ways that are not supported by official tools. Additionally, we constantly add new features
and make improvements to the CLI to make it more user-friendly based on client needs and feedback.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Third-party plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Apigee CLI also supports the ability to load third-party plugins (to be documented)
as additional commands which enables us (and third-party developers) to distribute their own commands
for very specific use cases, including those do not require any interaction with the Apigee Management API,
while being able to leverage the command-line interface without any knowledge of the CLI internals.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When to use this over the official tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Apigee Corporation provides their own CLI for the Apigee Management API:

GitHub repo at `apigeetool-node`_.

It is fully-featured, well-supported and can be used as an SDK to orchestrate tasks
and may be more than suitable for your needs.

If however, you have certain use cases that cannot be satisfied by this tool,
then the Apigee CLI may have what you need.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Specialised use cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some use cases that are too specialised for official tools are listed below (links and docs coming soon).

* Using CI/CD on SSO/SAML and MFA enabled Apigee Edge organizations while allowing clients to perform self-service operations using their personal accounts (MFA) or after authenticating with their identity provider (SSO/SAML)
* Provisioning API proxy deployments generated from best practice templates
* Using resource permissions files as templates for team user roles
* Distributing and developing third-party plugins as commands
* Encrypting KVMs at rest and decrypting during CI/CD
* Taking and restoring snapshots of Apigee Edge

Some of these use cases require plugins. These will be documented and made available soon.

---------------
Getting Started
---------------

Before using apigee-cli, you need to tell it about your Apigee Edge credentials. You
can do this in three ways:

* Environment variables
* Config file
* Command-line arguments

The quickest way to get started is to run the ``apigee configure`` command::

    $ apigee configure
    Apigee username (email) []: my_email
    Apigee password []: my_pass
    Apigee MFA key (optional) []: my_key
    Identity zone name (to support SAML authentication) []:
    Use OAuth, no MFA (optional)? [y/N]: n
    Default Apigee organization (recommended) []: my_org
    Default team/resource prefix (optional) []:

You can also do the same thing using command-line arguments::

    $ apigee configure -P default -u <my_email> -p <my_pass> -o <my_org> -mfa '' -z '' --no-token --prefix ''

You may need to specify empty strings as above. Also note the ``--prefix`` option. This option
will filter the output of some commands, such as the ``list`` type commands, by the prefix which may be useful to some people,
but if you want to avoid confusion just keep this value empty. You can also explicitly specify the ``--prefix``
for those commands if you need it on the fly.


To use environment variables, do the following::

    $ export APIGEE_USERNAME=<my_email>
    $ export APIGEE_PASSWORD=<my_pass>
    $ export APIGEE_MFA_SECRET=<my_key>
    $ export APIGEE_ZONENAME=<my_zonename>
    $ export APIGEE_IS_TOKEN=<bool>
    $ export APIGEE_ORG=<my_org>
    $ export APIGEE_CLI_PREFIX=<my_prefix>


To use the configuration file, create an INI formatted file like this::

    [default]
    username = my_email
    org = my_org
    mfa_secret = my_key
    prefix = my_prefix
    password = my_pass

    [produser]
    org = my_org
    username = my_email
    password = my_pass
    mfa_secret = my_key

and place it in ``~/.apigee/credentials``.

As you can see, you can have multiple ``profiles`` defined in the configuration file. You can then specify which
profile to use by using the ``-P/--profile`` option. If no profile is specified
the ``default`` profile is used.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Using SAML authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you specified an ``Identity zone name (to support SAML authentication)`` during setup,
the CLI will automatically use SAML authentication.
If you are not currently signed in by your identity provider, you will be prompted to sign in::

    $ apigee apis list
    SSO authorization page has automatically been opened in your default browser.
    Follow the instructions in the browser to complete this authorization request.

    If your browser did not automatically open, go to the following URL and sign in:

    https://{zoneName}.login.apigee.com/passcode

    then copy the Temporary Authentication Code.

    Please enter the Temporary Authentication Code:

``zoneName`` will be the ``Identity zone name`` you previously configured.

Refer to the official Apigee documentation to learn more about how to `Access the Edge API with SAML`_.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Deploy API Proxy bundles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can also deploy API proxy bundles to Apigee.

This command is an enhanced version of the Apigee API Proxy Deploy Tool.

It supports a bunch of useful features such as MFA, SAML, seamless deployments and automatic handling of ``missing`` and broken deployments.

.. code-block:: text

    $ apigee apis deploy -n API_NAME -e ENVIRONMENT -d DIRECTORY_WITH_APIPROXY

Some notable options::

    Deployment options: [mutually_exclusive]
                                    The deployment options
      -i, --import-only / -I, --no-import-only
                                    import only and not deploy
      -s, --seamless-deploy / -S, --no-seamless-deploy
                                    seamless deploy the bundle

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Cleaning up undeployed revisions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If deploying via CI/CD you may end up with a lot of undeployed revisions. In this case, you can
make use of the ``clean`` command to delete all undeployed revisions.

.. code-block:: text

    $ apigee apis clean -n API_NAME

You can also specify to keep the last few revisions::

    $ apigee apis clean -n API_NAME --save-last 10

To only show which revisions will be deleted but not actually delete anything, use the following option::

      --dry-run / --no-dry-run  show revisions to be deleted but do not delete

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Push commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Some commands support the ``push`` subcommand which combines API calls to manage the creation, update and sometimes deletion of resources using a single command.

Push commands read JSON from a file and can be invoked like so::

    $ apigee keyvaluemaps push -e <env> -f <file_path.json>

This will create the KVM if it does not exist, and update it if it does.
