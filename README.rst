positional arguments:
    apiproducts (apiprods, prods, products)
                        API products enable you to bundle and distribute your
                        APIs to multiple developer groups simultaneously,
                        without having to modify code.
    apis                
                        The proxy APIs let you perform operations on API
                        proxies, such as create, delete, update, and deploy.
    apps                
                        Management APIs available for working with developer
                        apps.
    authorization (auth)
                        Custom authorization commands. More information on the
                        use cases for these commands are yet to be documented.
    backup              
                        Downloads Apigee Edge configuration files for API
                        proxies, key value maps, target servers, caches,
                        developers, API products, developer apps, and user
                        roles (including permissions and associated users).
    caches              
                        A lightweight persistence store that can be used by
                        policies or code executing on the Apigee Edge. To
                        support data segregation, cache resources are scoped
                        to environments.
    configure           
                        Configure Apigee Edge credentials.
    debug (trace, debugsessions)
                        Manage sessions configured in Apigee Edge to record
                        specified messages and associated pipeline processing
                        metadata for debugging purposes
    deployments (deps)  
                        API proxies that are actively deployed in environments
                        on Apigee Edge.
    developers (devs)   
                        Developers implement client/consumer apps and must be
                        registered with an organization on Apigee Edge.
    keyvaluemaps (kvms)
                        Key/value maps at the environment scope can be
                        accessed by any API proxy in the environment (such as
                        test or prod). In the management UI (APIs >
                        Environment Configuration), key/value maps are at the
                        environment scope.
    maskconfigs (masks)
                        Specify data that will be filtered out of trace
                        sessions.
    permissions (perms)
                        Permissions for roles in an organization on Apigee
                        Edge.
    restore             
                        Restore specific resources from backups generated by
                        the backup command.
    sharedflows (sf)    
                        APIs to manage shared flows and flow hooks.
    stats               
                        A source of metrics collected by Apigee Edge that
                        measure API consumption and performance, used to build
                        Analytics reports.
    targetservers (ts)  
                        TargetServers are used to decouple TargetEndpoint
                        HTTPTargetConnections from concrete URLs for backend
                        services.
    userroles (roles)   
                        Roles for users in an organization on Apigee Edge.
                        User roles form the basis of role-based access in
                        Apigee Edge. Users are associated with one or more
                        userroles. Each userrole defines a set of permissions
                        (GET, PUT, DELETE) on RBAC resources (defined by URI
                        paths).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
