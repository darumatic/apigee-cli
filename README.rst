------------
Installation
------------

The easiest way to install apigee-cli is to use `pip`_ in a ``virtualenv``::

    $ pip install apigeecli

or, if you are not installing in a ``virtualenv``, to install globally::

    $ sudo pip install apigeecli

or for your user::

    $ pip install --user apigeecli

If you have the apigee-cli installed and want to upgrade to the latest version
you can run::

    $ pip install --upgrade apigeecli

--------------------
Why does this exist?
--------------------

Apigee CLI is a user-friendly command-line interface to the Apigee Edge Management API providing
automation capabilities with multi-factor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on (SSO)/SAML support.
It is intended for general administrative use from your shell, as a package for developers,
and to support automation for common development tasks, such as test automation
or Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Third-party plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Apigee CLI also supports the ability to load third-party plugins (to be documented)
as additional commands which enables us (and third-party developers) to distribute their own commands
for very specific use cases, including those do not require any interaction with the Apigee Management API,
while being able to leverage the command-line interface without any knowledge of the CLI internals.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
How we and our clients use it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We built and use the Apigee CLI to implement and distribute features that allow our clients
to manage CI/CD, perform self-service operations and promote our DevOps workflows
in ways that are not supported by official tools. These include but are not limited to:

* Enabling clients to easily use personal accounts (MFA) or authenticate with their identity provider (SSO/SAML)
* Using CI/CD when SSO/SAML and MFA are enabled for an Apigee Edge organization
* Provisioning API proxy deployments generated from best practice templates
* Using resource permissions template files to generate team user roles
* Distributing and developing specialized plugins as commands
* Encrypting KVMs at rest and decrypting during CI/CD
* Managing snapshots of Apigee Edge

We also constantly add new features and make improvements to the CLI to make it more user-friendly
based on client needs and feedback.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When to use this over the official tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Apigee Corporation has their own CLI for the Apigee Management API named `apigeetool-node`_.

It is fully-featured, well-supported and can be used as an SDK to orchestrate tasks
and may be more than suitable for your needs.

If however, you have certain use cases that cannot be satisfied by this tool,
then the Apigee CLI may have what you need.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Specialized use cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of these use cases require plugins. These will be documented and made available at a later date.

---------------
Getting Started
---------------

Before using apigee-cli, you need to tell it about your Apigee Edge credentials. You
can do this in three ways:

* Environment variables
* Config file
* Command-line arguments

The quickest way to get started is to run the ``apigee configure`` command::

    $ apigee configure
    Apigee username (email) []: MY_EMAIL
    Apigee password []: MY_PASS
    Apigee MFA key (optional) []: MY_KEY
    Identity zone name (to support SAML authentication) []:
    Use OAuth, no MFA (optional)? [y/N]: n
    Default Apigee organization (recommended) []: MY_ORG
    Default team/resource prefix (optional) []:

You may not need to input anything for some of these prompts. In these cases, simply press ``enter`` to skip.

You can also do the same thing using command-line arguments::

    $ apigee configure -P default -u MY_EMAIL -p MY_PASS -o MY_ORG -mfa '' -z '' --no-token --prefix ''

You may need to specify empty strings as above. Also note the ``--prefix`` option. This option
will filter the output of some commands, such as the ``list`` type commands, by the prefix which may be useful to some people,
but if you want to avoid confusion just keep this value empty. You can also explicitly specify the ``--prefix``
for those commands if you need it on the fly.


To use environment variables, do the following::

    $ export APIGEE_USERNAME=MY_EMAIL
    $ export APIGEE_PASSWORD=MY_PASS
    $ export APIGEE_MFA_SECRET=MY_KEY
    $ export APIGEE_ZONENAME=MY_ZONENAME
    $ export APIGEE_IS_TOKEN=BOOL
    $ export APIGEE_ORG=MY_ORG
    $ export APIGEE_CLI_PREFIX=MY_PREFIX


To use the configuration file, create an INI formatted file like this::

    [default]
    username = MY_EMAIL
    org = MY_ORG
    mfa_secret = MY_KEY
    prefix = MY_PREFIX
    password = MY_PASS

    [produser]
    org = MY_ORG
    username = MY_EMAIL
    password = MY_PASS
    mfa_secret = MY_KEY

and place it in ``~/.apigee/credentials``.

As you can see, you can have multiple ``profiles`` defined in the configuration file. You can then specify which
profile to use by using the ``-P/--profile`` option. If no profile is specified
the ``default`` profile is used.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Using SAML authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you specified an ``Identity zone name (to support SAML authentication)`` during setup,
the CLI will automatically use SAML authentication.
If you are not currently signed in by your identity provider, you will be prompted to sign in::

    $ apigee apis list
    SSO authorization page has automatically been opened in your default browser.
    Follow the instructions in the browser to complete this authorization request.

    If your browser did not automatically open, go to the following URL and sign in:

    https://{zoneName}.login.apigee.com/passcode

    then copy the Temporary Authentication Code.

    Please enter the Temporary Authentication Code:

``zoneName`` will be the ``Identity zone name`` you previously configured.

Refer to the official Apigee documentation to learn more about how to `Access the Edge API with SAML`_.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Deploy API Proxy bundles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can also deploy API proxy bundles to Apigee.

This command is an enhanced version of the Apigee API Proxy Deploy Tool.

It supports a bunch of useful features such as MFA, SAML, seamless deployments and automatic handling of ``missing`` and broken deployments.

.. code-block:: text

    $ apigee apis deploy -n API_NAME -e ENVIRONMENT -d DIRECTORY_WITH_APIPROXY

Some notable options::

    Deployment options: [mutually_exclusive]
                                    The deployment options
      -i, --import-only / -I, --no-import-only
                                    import only and not deploy
      -s, --seamless-deploy / -S, --no-seamless-deploy
                                    seamless deploy the bundle

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Cleaning up undeployed revisions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If deploying via CI/CD you may end up with a lot of undeployed revisions. In this case, you can
make use of the ``clean`` command to delete all undeployed revisions.

.. code-block:: text

    $ apigee apis clean -n API_NAME

You can also specify to keep the last few revisions::

    $ apigee apis clean -n API_NAME --save-last INTEGER

To only show which revisions will be deleted but not actually delete anything, use the following option::

      --dry-run / --no-dry-run  show revisions to be deleted but do not delete

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Push commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Some commands support the ``push`` subcommand which combines API calls to manage the creation, update and sometimes deletion of resources using a single command.

Push commands read JSON from a file and can be invoked like so::

    $ apigee keyvaluemaps push -e ENVIRONMENT -f FILENAME

This will create the KVM if it does not exist, and update it if it does.

----------------
Managing plugins
----------------
The simple plugins manager uses Git to install commands from remote sources, thus you will need to have Git installed for installation to work.
However, it is possible to install plugins manually by storing plugins in the correct location (to be documented).

Currently, only the commands below are supported. More commands will be added to improve automation and user experience.

The steps below show how to install commands from a public plugins repository located here:

* https://github.com/mdelotavo/apigee-cli-plugins

^^^^^^^^^^^
Configuring
^^^^^^^^^^^

To configure remote sources for installing plugins, run::

    apigee plugins configure -a

This will open a text editor so that you can specify the remote sources.

If you don't want changes to be automatically applied, then you can drop the ``-a`` option.

When the editor opens, copy and paste the following example configuration::

    [sources]
    public = https://github.com/mdelotavo/apigee-cli-plugins.git

After saving the changes, the CLI will attempt to install the plugins from the specified Git URI.
Here we use the HTTPS URI but you can also use SSH if you have configured it.

You can also specify multiple sources, as long as the key (``public`` in this case) is unique.
The key will be the name of the repository on your local machine under ``~/.apigee/plugins/``.

If installation is successful, you should now see additional commands when you run ``apigee -h``

^^^^^^^^
Updating
^^^^^^^^

If you specified the ``-a`` option when running ``apigee plugins configure`` then install will occur automatically.
Otherwise you can run::

     apigee plugins update

This will install and update plugins.

^^^^^^^
Pruning
^^^^^^^

If you specified the ``-a`` option when running ``apigee plugins configure`` then the removal of plugins will occur automatically.
Otherwise you can run::

     apigee plugins prune

^^^^^^^
Showing
^^^^^^^

To show the plugins you have configured, run::

     apigee plugins show

You can also run the following commands if you specify the plugin name::

    apigee plugins show -n PLUGIN_NAME --show-commit-only
    apigee plugins show -n PLUGIN_NAME --show-dependencies-only

Some plugins will not load if dependencies are not installed. You can run the following command to install them.
In order for this to work, the plugin needs to have the ``Requires`` key in the JSON body of the ``apigee-cli.info`` file.
More details coming soon.::

    pip3 install $(apigee plugins show -n PLUGIN_NAME --show-dependencies-only)

^^^^^^^^^^^^
How it works
^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. The plugins manager ``apigee/plugins/commands.py`` will clone or pull remote repositories into ``~/.apigee/plugins/``.
2. The ``_load_all_modules_in_directory()`` function in ``apigee/__main__.py`` will attempt to import the functions as specified in the ``__init__.py`` file for each plugin repository found in ``~/.apigee/plugins/``.
3. If the functions found are of instance type ``(click.core.Command, click.core.Group)`` then the CLI will add it to the list of available commands.

Further details are to be documented, including how to write plugins and leverage some useful CLI libraries.
