--------------------
positional arguments
--------------------
This section lists some useful commands. To find more commands use the ``-h, --help`` flag.

``apiproducts (apiprods, prods, products)``
^^^^^
API products enable you to bundle and distribute your
APIs to multiple developer groups simultaneously,
without having to modify code.



``apis``
^^^^^
The proxy APIs let you perform operations on API
proxies, such as create, delete, update, and deploy.

Upload and deploy an ``apiproxy/`` bundle::

    apigee apis deploy --directory APIPROXY_BUNDLE --environment ENVIRONMENT --name API_NAME

List the names of all API proxies::

    apigee apis list

Download an API proxy revision, along with any referenced key/value maps, target servers and caches::

    apigee apis pull \
        --environment ENVIRONMENT \
        --name API_NAME \
        --revision-number REVISION_NUMBER \
        --work-tree TARGET_DIRECTORY

Delete all undeployed revisions of an API proxy::

    apigee apis clean --name API_NAME

options:

--save-last N         denotes not to delete the N most recent revisions
--dry-run             show revisions to be deleted but do not delete

``apps``
^^^^^
Management APIs available for working with developer
apps.

``authorization (auth)``
^^^^^
Custom authorization commands. More information on the
use cases for these commands are yet to be documented.

``backup``
^^^^^
Downloads Apigee Edge configuration files for API
proxies, key value maps, target servers, caches,
developers, API products, developer apps, and user
roles (including permissions and associated users).

``caches``
^^^^^
A lightweight persistence store that can be used by
policies or code executing on the Apigee Edge. To
support data segregation, cache resources are scoped
to environments.

``configure``
^^^^^
Configure Apigee Edge credentials.

``debug (trace, debugsessions)``
^^^^^
Manage sessions configured in Apigee Edge to record
specified messages and associated pipeline processing
metadata for debugging purposes

``deployments (deps)``
^^^^^
API proxies that are actively deployed in environments
on Apigee Edge.

``developers (devs)``
^^^^^
Developers implement client/consumer apps and must be
registered with an organization on Apigee Edge.

``keyvaluemaps (kvms)``
^^^^^
Key/value maps at the environment scope can be
accessed by any API proxy in the environment (such as
test or prod). In the management UI (APIs >
Environment Configuration), key/value maps are at the
environment scope.

``maskconfigs (masks)``
^^^^^
Specify data that will be filtered out of trace
sessions.

``permissions (perms)``
^^^^^
Permissions for roles in an organization on Apigee
Edge.

``restore``
^^^^^
Restore specific resources from backups generated by
the backup command.

``sharedflows (sf)``
^^^^^
APIs to manage shared flows and flow hooks.

``stats``
^^^^^
A source of metrics collected by Apigee Edge that
measure API consumption and performance, used to build
Analytics reports.

``targetservers (ts)``
^^^^^
TargetServers are used to decouple TargetEndpoint
HTTPTargetConnections from concrete URLs for backend
services.

``userroles (roles)``
^^^^^
Roles for users in an organization on Apigee Edge.
User roles form the basis of role-based access in
Apigee Edge. Users are associated with one or more
userroles. Each userrole defines a set of permissions
(GET, PUT, DELETE) on RBAC resources (defined by URI
paths).

------------------
optional arguments
------------------
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-V, --version         show program's version number and exit
--silent              toggle silent output
-v, --verbose         toggle verbose output
